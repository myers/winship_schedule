# TODO

* make the 2024-2074 calendar
* make even years the odd years + 5 off of what the even years are
* write tests that check that no share has two time slots less than 4 weeks apart
* write tests that shows no one gets a single holiday twice in a row
* with the 2023 schedule we've got Frank May with only a few weeks between

## Complaints / Comments

* All 4 of the Frank Latimer's weeks fall in the first four months of the calendar. Can these be spaced out more throughout the calendar year?
* The Frank Latimer's have two weeks almost back to back in March of 2024. Can this be spaced out more?
